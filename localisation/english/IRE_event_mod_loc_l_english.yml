    ireland.1.d:0 "During the 1930s, Ireland was still dealing with the aftermath of its fight for independence and the separation caused by the treaty that divided it from the United Kingdom. There was a political division in the country between the people who saw the Treaty as a path towards independence and those who continued to fight for a complete Irish Republic. This division continued to exist, and it had an impact on the country's politics, causing opposing parties to emerge."
    ireland.2.d:0 "In the 1930s, Ireland retained its rural essence, but the lack of significant industrialisation cast a shadow over its bucolic beauty. As the rest of the world moved into the modern age, Ireland's landscape remained dominated by timeless farms, green fields and tranquil hamlets. However, the lack of industrial progress meant that opportunities for economic growth were limited. As a result, poverty was widespread throughout the country. Despite the picturesque charm that continued to define the Irish countryside, the rural idyll masked underlying struggles as the nation grappled with the challenges of modernisation and its impact on the livelihoods of its people."
    ireland.3.d:0 "In the 1930s, Ireland retained its rural essence, but its lack of significant industrialization cast a shadow over its bucolic beauty. As the rest of the world surged forward into the modern age, Ireland's landscape remained dominated by timeless farms, verdant fields, and tranquil hamlets. However, the absence of industrial progress meant that opportunities for economic growth were limited, resulting in pockets of pervasive poverty across the nation. Despite the picturesque charm that continued to define the Irish countryside, the rural idyll masked underlying struggles as the nation grappled with the challenges of modernization and its impact on its people's livelihoods."
