    ireland.1.d:0 "In the 1930s, Ireland was still navigating the aftermath of its struggle for independence and the division caused by the treaty that separated it from the United Kingdom. The country was marked by a political divide between those who accepted the Treaty as a step towards independence and those who fought on for a complete Irish Republic. This division persisted, influencing the country's politics and leading to the emergence of opposing parties."
    ireland.2.d:0 "In the 1930s, Ireland retained its rural essence, but its lack of significant industrialization cast a shadow over its bucolic beauty. As the rest of the world surged forward into the modern age, Ireland's landscape remained dominated by timeless farms, verdant fields, and tranquil hamlets. However, the absence of industrial progress meant that opportunities for economic growth were limited, resulting in pockets of pervasive poverty across the nation. Despite the picturesque charm that continued to define the Irish countryside, the rural idyll masked underlying struggles as the nation grappled with the challenges of modernization and its impact on its people's livelihoods."
