    britain.labour.3.d:0 "After the War us the People decide that we cannot tolerate the King and his family anymore and we hunt them out of OUR Isles, after the Third English Revolution we started a new government but still today we need to do many things"
    britain.labour.4.d:0 "The last 14 years have been marked by various conflicts among the members of the British Commission. Faced with a new discussion, the Secretary of the Labour Party has decided to convene the first election for a new British Government that can independently determine the fate of the Union."
    britain.labour.5.d:0 "In the elections, a clear winner did not emerge, but rather dissent. Ballot boxes are devoid of votes throughout England, and as time goes on, tension in the streets of London continues to rise. There are rumors that the opponents of the revolution are about to overthrow the government."  
    britain.labour.6.d:0 "The arrival at Downing Street hadn't been simple, but Lord Protector Churchill knew that the true challenge was to maintain this position firmly. Casting a glance out of the window, he could already see the tension rising. The people needed to swiftly forget these years under the Reds and remember themselves as a proud nation under a strong King. The King, another dilemma for the Lord Protector. If they were called Protectors of the Roses, there was a reason many hoped to ward off a return of the Windsors and instead fervently called for a phantom-like return to Tudor greatness. It was the time they had declared independence from Rome and Madrid. Both matters were of equal importance, and resources were scarce. A swift decision needed to be made. Should they take the remains of the Labour Union and dismantle them, or should they crown a new King"
    britain.labour.7.d:0 "<Perhaps it might truly be possible to return to the Roses> as he sifted through the dust with a glass of whisky in hand, Churchill recalled an old discussion <What would have happened if the nobles had respected the will of Henry VIII and prioritized the inheritance of his younger sister?> A quick check revealed two names, one quite familiar, Earl of Jersey George Child Villiers, and the other rather unknown, the 11th Lady Kinloss Mary Morgan-Grenville. A few days later, after meticulous research, the packet of documents confirming their right to the Throne of the Kingdom of England sat on the Lord Protector's desk. How should we proceed now, sir?"
    britain.labour.8.d:0 "The meeting with the Earl turned out to be quite candid. The Earl was aware of his potential claim, but the family had long abandoned hopes of reclaiming the title. The offer that was presented held many merits, and the Lord Protector was sincere. What was needed was a King who wouldn't interfere with the functioning of the Government and would follow its guidelines. By the end of their dinner, Churchill had a clear understanding of the character before him. He sensed that this individual might require more effort to manage and control. Additionally, he believed that the Earl's pedigree would be immensely useful in forming the English Court that was needed in the eyes of the people and the international audience."
    britain.labour.9.d:0 "The old Lady Kinloss had lived for a long time in India and served under her father, the Duke and Governor, in various prestigious roles. They discovered they had already crossed paths during the glorious imperial past. In her words, one could sense the 20-year age gap between them. When the Lord Protector presented his proposal, her reaction was one of innocence. <Ending my life as the Queen of England doesn't sound bad at all. Don't think me foolish, Winston. I know you desire someone to support your government from the throne. You must have assessed my knowledge and my situation, and you know that I cannot afford to contradict you, even with the scepter in hand.> It was before leaving that she made one last comment, which remained imprinted in the Lord Protector's mind <Queens indeed have had considerable luck in this country.>"
    britain.labour.10.d:0 "Within the government, the secrecy regarding the Lord Protector's intentions about the future King didn't last long. Initially, amidst the fervor of the uprising, many had dismissed the idea of bringing the Windsors back home. However, as the days passed, this notion crept back among the various supporters of Churchill. He found himself contemplating whether to invite the Windsors to return from their African exile. After consulting with his cabinet, he understood that whatever decision he made would be supported by all"
