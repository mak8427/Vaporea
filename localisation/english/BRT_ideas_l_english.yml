 the_council_sistem_desc:0 "After the Revolution, power within the Union was entrusted to the Labour Council, with the hope of giving voice to all factions within the Labour Party. However, it has actually proven to be an impediment multiple times due to the various internal debates it has sparked. Viewed unfavorably by the people and even by politicians themselves, several voices have arisen on numerous occasions to dismantle it and replace it with a new form of government."
 the_council_sistem_2_h:0 "Toward the High Labour Council"
 the_council_sistem_2_h_desc:0 "Our Secretary, Comrade Mosley, has presented the changes that will be introduced to address the issues of the Council. Few seem to realize that with these changes, the Council will become a purely symbolic body, and its powers will gradually be transferred to the Secretary. Voices that rose in opposition were quickly silenced."
  the_council_sistem_3_h:0 "The High Labour Council"
 the_council_sistem_3_h_desc:0 "The High Labour Council meets every day from morning till evening, and according to the reports published, there are spirited discussions about the party's grand projects and the Secretary. Perhaps the Council Representatives also believe this, but the reality is quite different; the Council has become a futile body that only serves to strengthen Secretary Mosley's power through symbolic acts."
 the_council_sistem_2_l:0 "Toward the Low Labour Council"
 the_council_sistem_2_l_desc:0 "Secretary Pollitt's plans aim to address the issues of the council by drawing inspiration from the old House of Commons. They intend to broaden its functions, creating a colossal body to support the government that serves as the foundation for the country's political processes. Those who argue that all this will only create more problems are often disregarded."
 the_council_sistem_3_l:0 "The Low Labour Council"
 the_council_sistem_3_l_desc:0 "The Low Labour Council is a bureaucratic marvel to behold, reclaiming the seat and form of the old House of Commons. It has established a bridge between the past and the future of this nation for the British People. It's true that sometimes old issues resurface, but the new streamlined organization tackles these unforeseen challenges with renewed and found efficiency."
